        Hello everyone. My name is Jessica Miller.  I live and work in Mexico, Missouri.  I teach middle school math, science, and robotics at Missouri Military Academy.  I have four wonderful boys, Jayden (13), Grayson (7), Jaxson (4), and Wesley (2). This is my second semester at Mizzou. I do not have much experience with Web Design. I think I did a little web design in high school. I can’t wait to dive into this course and have so much fun.  I am unsure what to do with my newly found knowledge, but I’m excited to see what I learn. Once I complete my degree in Instructional Design, I plan to move out of the classroom.  One thing I enjoy, especially in the summer, is running.  Running a half-marathon is on my bucket list! One hobby that I enjoy all the time but wish I had more time for is sewing.
